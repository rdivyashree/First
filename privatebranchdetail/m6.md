**Undo local changes** > you can replace the changes in your working tree with the last content in head
Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept.
_git checkout -- <filename>_
Instead, to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it, do this:	
git fetch origin
_git reset --hard origin/master_
